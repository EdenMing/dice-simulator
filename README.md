a simple dice simulator for a monopoly map built on streamlit
it allows you to enter the number of dice you want, the faces of the dice, the number of the blocks/positions on a looped monopoly map, the times you want for simulation
and it tells you how many steps you will need to cover all the blocks/positions in those simulations, the probability of completion by steps
